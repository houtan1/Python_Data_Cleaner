# import the pandas module
import pandas as pd

# read in the stripped data into a dataframe and print it
df = pd.read_table('data/Doering-etal_2018-strip.tab')
print(df)

# show if any values in the dataframe are null
#isNullDf = pd.isna(df)
#print(isNullDf)

# Goal 1. Remove any duplicated columns
# the drop_duplicates() function of pandas removes rows with duplicated values
# to make this work for columns, we'll transpose the table first so columns become rows that we can detect duplications of
df = df.T.drop_duplicates().T

# Goal 2. Remove any duplicated rows
# use the regular instance of the drop_duplicates() functions
df = df.drop_duplicates()

# Goal 3. Spot/Drop rows with missing field(s)
df = df.dropna()

# Goal 4. Field format inconsistencies
# print(df.dtypes)
# print(df.info())
# print(df['Depth water [m]'] + df['Temp [Â°C]'] + df['Longitude'])
# note, all columns show up as "object" type which is equivalent to string
# but adding those strings behaves like adding numbers...

# Goal 5. Illogical fields values and outliers

# Filter out all rows that have at least one value outside the standard deviation
# df = df[(dfnum_bool).all(axis=1)]

# print out the different types for each column
# print(df.dtypes)

# parse our year column as datetime format
# print(pd.to_datetime(df))
# this is hopeless, since I can't tell it specifically which combination of
# columns to use to construct a date time column
# it's trying to be smart but that breaks down unless you have at least three
# columns that specify year, month, day or some abbreviation of them


# integrate Stephen's code into mine
# try to single out a column of data and find its distribution using pandas or scipy or numpi or matplotlib?
